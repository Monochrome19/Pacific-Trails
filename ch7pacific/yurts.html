        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
        yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnised?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-sized bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
        Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water.
        Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
        weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight
        and sense of adventure!</dd>
